extract given names from wiki data

update (new to old): 

in <Extract_Wiki_Data_names_try_01.ipynb>: 
used package "qwikidata", better than the previous one
1. find similar first names baesd on a given first name
2. fiind (first name + last name) pairs based on the same first name
3. find (first name + last name) pairs for female politicians

in <Extract_Wiki_Data_names_try_00.ipynb>
1. only tried with getting similar names for Gregory atm, will run code on all names gathered.
